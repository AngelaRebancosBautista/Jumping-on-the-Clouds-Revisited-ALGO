# Jumping-on-the-Clouds-Revisited-ALGO

/This program simulates a cloud-jumping game where the player starts with 100 energy and loses 1 energy per jump, plus an extra 2 if landing on a thundercloud. It keeps jumping in steps of size k around the circular cloud array until returning to the start, then outputs the remaining energy.
